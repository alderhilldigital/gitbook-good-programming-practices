# Reusability

Reusability has the ability to drastically increase the efficiency of writing software and enable continuing improvement and innovation by reusing code that another person has invested the time and effort into writing.

## What is code reuse?

Most programming languages inherently have code reusability built in. The whole point of a programming language is that is has particular keywords and formats that initiate other pieces of code to do a particular task. This is code reuse. When writing code the writer can use this same process to write a piece of code that they can later reference and use to complete that task again or even multiple times.

**Example**

`welcome(name){    
    print "Hello #{name}. How are you today? The current time is #{Time.now()}."    
}     
welcome('John')`

In this example the welcome message can be reused to welcome different people without having to retype the whole message each time.
