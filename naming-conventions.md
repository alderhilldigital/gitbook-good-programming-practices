# Naming Conventions

Naming conventions are very important when programming. Some programming languages dictate certain name conventions where others leave it up to organisation policy or personal preference.

# What are naming conventions?

Programming languages have various elements that require being named for when they need to be referenced. It is best to maintained a standardised method when naming an element. These are known as a naming conventions.

## Types of Naming Convention

There are some common industry naming conventions that are adopted in different ways across most programming languages.

Upper case - All letters in upper case. Commonly used for keywords and constants e.g. UPPERCASE

Lower case - All letters in lower case. Commonly used for variable types e.g. lowercase

Snake case - All lower case letters with words separated by an underscore. Adopted by many web languages. e.g. snake\_case

Kebab case - All lowercase letters with words separated by a hyphen e.g. kebab-case

Camel case - All lowercase letters except for any new words not including the first word e.g. camelCase

## Benefits of Naming Conventions

Good naming conventions can make it easier for the reader to read and understand the code. Spacing words using underscores or hyphens makes the individual words more readable but maintains a single entity structure to the name. 

A naming convention policy can save time when working in a team as there is no need for discussion on what format should be taken for naming conventions. Also, formalising this type of expectation will help to promote consistency and a certain level of precision. Since much of a naming convention is based on the opinion of the the people involved, these opinions can vary and if no policy is in place may cause disagreements and use up valuable time in a project. 

A naming convention may also help to remove the possibility of name duplication. Some languages and pieces of software that assist with writing code have functionality to notify or automatically refactor code. This detection or refactoring may rely on the naming conventions used by the language or software.
