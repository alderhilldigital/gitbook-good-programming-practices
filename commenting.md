# Commenting

Commenting is one of the most important practices when engaging in a development project, especially when the project involves other people. It is also one of the practices that is commonly overlooked by many developers.

### What are comments?

Code can sometimes be difficult to follow and real language can help with people's understanding. Comments are descriptions that are appended or prepended to code that explain what the code does. Comments have no affect on how the code executes and are ignored by many compilers and interpreters.

### How to comment

Comments have to common forms, inline and block. Inline comments usually have a character or character sequence that is used to initiate the comment. Inline comments can be used on a line on their own or at the end of a line of code.

**Example**

`// This function does something  
function does_stuff()`

or

`print "hello" // this prints hello`

In these examples the comment is initiated with a double forward slash '//'.

The other type of comments are block comments. Block comments also have a initiating character sequence but instead of the comment ending when a new line occurs, they require a terminating character sequence.

**Example**

`/*  
We can write a comment.  
It can have multiple lines.  
Then it is closed at the end  
*/`
