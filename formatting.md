# Formatting

Formatting code is a good way of making it more readable as well as some other benefits.

# What is formatting?

Formatting is the use of spacing and new lines to layout code for aesthetic and functional benefit. If code were to be written all on one line with no spaces it would be much more difficult to read.

**Example**

`<div><ul><li><a href='#>Hello</a></li></ul></div>`

vs.

`<div>  
     <ul>  
         <li>  
             <a href='#>Hello</a>  
         </li>  
     </ul>  
 </div>`
